Running the Machine Learning

1. At minimum clone the "arduino" directory which is the parent of this file's parent (smart_dog_collar)
2. Install the Arduino IDE if you haven't already
3. Open up the smart_dog_collar.ino file in your Arduino IDE
4. Connect the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev 2 to your device
5. Double click the white reset button to put it in bootloader mode
6. Click on "Upload" to upload code to the arduino (Might take a few minutes)
7. If any errors pop up you might need to install libraries using the Library Manager. The libraries needed are found under arduino/lib
