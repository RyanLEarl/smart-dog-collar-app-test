# Hardware Setup

## Required Materials

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2
- ESP32 WiFi Microcontroller
- Two USB-A to micro-USB cables
- USB battery with at least two USB-A ports

## Wiring

If you want to program either device, make sure they are completely disconnected from each other.

1. Connect ESP32's PIN 16 to Arduino's PIN TX1.
2. Connect ESP32's PIN 17 to Arduino's PIN RX0.
3. Connect ESP32's PIN GND (choose any) to Arduino's PIN GND (choose any).
4. Connect ESP32 and Arduino to USB battery with USB cables.
