      <p>This project seeks to develop a smart dog collar prototype that detects seizures in dogs. 
        Leveraging this accelerometer and gyroscope data, machine learning models can be trained and deployed to detect seizures in real-time.  The collar will be connected to an app for the owner so they can monitor their dogs behaviours and receive notifications of seizures in real-time. This allows instant action to be taken to mitigate the negative effects of a seizure. 
        Current goal is to design and build a dozen devices to be used in a formal research study.

      <p>When looking on the market for smart dog collars, many offer products that track normal
         dog activity such as sleeping, walking, and running. What we aim to provide is a product 
         that does both that and provides the detection of seizures in dogs which is not available 
         in any current products. This will help owners feel at ease when they cannot be with their 
         pets in their moment of need.
